# Type classes


## Type class for Equality

The Lem equality is translated using the type class `Eq`, defined in
`library/basic_classes.lem`, with operations `=` (`isEqual`) and `<>`
(`isInequal`) for equality and inequality.

For HOL and Isabelle, this is always mapped to their standard equalities.

However, for OCaml, the default mapping to OCaml equality is not
always appropriate, and if a Lem development uses equality at any
types at which it is not, the user must provide a suitable
instantiation for type class `Eq`.  For example, one needs to
instantiate `Eq` for any inductively defined types that make use of
`natural` (mapped to OCaml big integers) or sets or maps, or
(recursively) any other types that do.  On a similar note, one also
needs to instantiate `Ord` (the type class for total linear orders)
to compare such user-defined types, and to use them in sets or maps.


## Type classes for Sets and Maps

Sets and Maps require comparison operations in OCaml and Coq.  This is
provided via type classes `SetType` and `MapType`, introduced in
`library/basic_classes.lem`;
the former has a single method `setElemCompare`.
The default OCaml instantiation of `SetType`
is with OCaml's `compare`, but if the user constructs sets of types
containing any tuples, records, or user-defined inductive types, those
types must also have an instance declaration for `SetType` with a
suitable comparison function.  If this is omitted, the default will be
used and there may be a run-time error as the equality test will be
incorrect.  `MapType` uses `SetType` as default implementation.

For example, for a simple inductive type:

    type memory_order = Atomic | NA

one can make it an instance of `SetType` as follows, as here the default OCaml `compare` and the theorem prover equalities will be correct.

    instance (SetType memory_order)
      let setElemCompare = defaultCompare
    end

For a more complex inductive type such as the following, with recursion through a set and pair constructor:

    type tree 'a =
      | Node of set ('a * tree 'a)

one can define an equality function making use of the underlying `setCompareBy` comparison on sets:

    val treeCompare : forall 'a . 
      ('a -> 'a -> ordering) -> (tree 'a) -> (tree 'a) -> ordering
    let rec treeCompare cmpa (Node xs) (Node ys) =  
      setCompareBy (pairCompare cmpa (treeCompare cmpa)) xs ys 

and make the `tree` type constructor instantiate `SetType` as follows:

    instance forall 'a. SetType 'a => (SetType (tree 'a))
      let setElemCompare = treeCompare setElemCompare
    end 

Tuple types up to a certain size are made an instance of `SetType` in `basic_classes.lem`; if one uses sets or maps of wider tuples, they must also be made instances following the same pattern, otherwise Lem will generate incorrect code.



## Other Standard Library Type Classes

The standard library defines several other type classes.   In `library/basic_classes.lem` we have, in addition to `Eq` and `SetType`:

- `Ord`  for total linear orders with comparison operations
- `OrdMaxMin`  extending `Ord` with max and min


In `map.lem` we have `MapKeyType`.


In `num.lem` there are various numeric types and type classes for the operations that they each may or may not support:

- `NumNegate`
- `NumAdd`
- `NumMinus`
- `NumMult`
- `NumPow`
- `NumDivision`
- `NumIntegerDivision`
- `NumRemainder`
- `NumSucc`
- `NumPred` 

In `word.lem` there is a type class `Word` of machine words, bitwise logical operations, and conversions to and from lists of booleans.
